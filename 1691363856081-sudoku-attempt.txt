  THIRD: Select the enemy letter to attack. Always select remainingEnemies[selectedEnemyIndex]. If selectedEnemyIndex >= remainingEnemies.length, then output "let selectedEnemyIndex = 0", and select the enemy letter at remainingEnemies[0].
  The selected enemy letter is 's'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 1

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking. You'll find one array between arrays one and nine (inclusive), one array between ten and eighteen (inclusive), and one array between nineteen and twenty-seven (inclusive).

  indexOf(s) in Array one: 2
  indexOf(s) in Array eleven: 0
  indexOf(s) in Array nineteen: 2

  EIGHTH: If any of these indexOf values === -1, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  None of the indexOf values are -1.

  NINTH: Go through the listed arrays and list only the numbers contained in those three arrays (i.e., remove the letters).
  Array one: [2, 1, 4, 8, 7]
  Array eleven: [5, 7, 1, 9]
  Array nineteen: [2, 1, 8, 9, 5]

  TENTH: Concatenate the three lists into a single list.
  [2, 1, 4, 8, 7, 5, 7, 1, 9, 2, 1, 8, 9, 5]

  ELEVENTH: Iterate through the concatenated list and REMOVE every LETTER, if there are no letters, then just re-output the list of numbers.
  [2, 1, 4, 8, 7, 5, 7, 1, 9, 2, 1, 8, 9, 5]

  TWELFTH: Dedupe this list.
  [2, 1, 4, 8, 7, 5, 9]

  THIRTEENTH: Sort this list.
  [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length = 7

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  CRITICAL HIT ABORTED!

  let selectedEnemyIndex = 1

  THIRD: Select the enemy letter to attack. Always select remainingEnemies[selectedEnemyIndex]. If selectedEnemyIndex >= remainingEnemies.length, then output "let selectedEnemyIndex = 0", and select the enemy letter at remainingEnemies[0].
  The selected enemy letter is 'r'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 2

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking. You'll find one array between arrays one and nine (inclusive), one array between ten and eighteen (inclusive), and one array between nineteen and twenty-seven (inclusive). Always list every element (every number and letter) of the three arrays found during this step.
  Array one: [2, 1, s, r, t, Z, 4, 8, 7]
  Array twelve: [r, 3, M, 5, b, 6, R, 1, l]
  Array twenty: [r, t, Z, 3, I, 2, M, 7, 1]

  SIXTH: If you don't have exactly three arrays (e.g., you have two arrays or four arrays), immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  We have exactly three arrays.

  SEVENTH: Go through the listed arrays and output indexOf(selectedEnemy) for each. Pay extra attention to case.
  indexOf(r) in Array one: 3
  indexOf(r) in Array twelve: 0
  indexOf(r) in Array twenty: 0

  EIGHTH: If any of these indexOf values === -1, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  None of the indexOf values are -1.

  NINTH: Go through the listed arrays and list only the numbers contained in those three arrays (i.e., remove the letters).
  Array one: [2, 1, 4, 8, 7]
  Array twelve: [3, 5, 6, 1]
  Array twenty: [3, 2, 7, 1]

  TENTH: Concatenate the three lists into a single list.
  [2, 1, 4, 8, 7, 3, 5, 6, 1, 3, 2, 7, 1]

  ELEVENTH: Iterate through the concatenated list and REMOVE every LETTER, if there are no letters, then just re-output the list of numbers.
  [2, 1, 4, 8, 7, 3, 5, 6, 1, 3, 2, 7, 1]

  TWELFTH: Dedupe this list.
  [2, 1, 4, 8, 7, 3, 5, 6]

  THIRTEENTH: Sort this list.
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length = 8

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  The missing number between 1 and 9 is 9.

  SIXTEENTH: Re-output the indexOf values from the SEVENTH step.
  indexOf(r) in Array one: 3
  indexOf(r) in Array twelve: 0
  indexOf(r) in Array twenty: 0

  SEVENTEENTH: For each of the three arrays from earlier, replace the letter at the indexOf value with the missing number.
  Array one: [2, 1, s, 9, t, Z, 4, 8, 7]
  Array twelve: [9, 3, M, 5, b, 6, R, 1, l]
  Array twenty: [9, t, Z, 3, I, 2, M, 7, 1]

  EIGHTEENTH: It's time to update the game state. The first thing you are required to do is come up with a unique name for the game state. Output the name. After you output the new game state name, output "let one =" on the next line. Then carefully finish printing the new game state, making sure to be precise and careful. You want it to be exactly like the previous game state except for the new updates that occurred this KICK SWEEP! Remember to include the new remainingEnemies. The reason you must always list everything out in full is that I'm copy-pasting your most recent response into a new chat, so if you fail to list it out in full, you'll irrevocably lose the game state information and necessarily fail at the game.

  let remainingEnemies = [s, t, Z, o, p, I, y, z, M, S, k, Y, F, V, w, e, G, b, i, j, g, q, C, B, m, d, c, R, f, K, u, n, O, a, W, A, U, H, T, l, h, E]

  let selectedEnemyIndex = 2

  THIRD: Select the enemy letter to attack. Always select remainingEnemies[selectedEnemyIndex]. If selectedEnemyIndex >= remainingEnemies.length, then output "let selectedEnemyIndex = 0", and select the enemy letter at remainingEnemies[0].
  The selected enemy letter is 't'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 3

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking. You'll find one array between arrays one and nine (inclusive), one array between ten and eighteen (inclusive), and one array between nineteen and twenty-seven (inclusive). Always list every element (every number and letter) of the three arrays found during this step.
  Array one: [2, 1, s, 9, t, Z, 4, 8, 7]
  Array thirteen: [t, I, 7, 9, i, C, f, W, 6]
  Array twenty: [9, t, Z, 3, I, 2, M, 7, 1]

  SIXTH: If you don't have exactly three arrays (e.g., you have two arrays or four arrays), immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  We have exactly three arrays.

  SEVENTH: Go through the listed arrays and output indexOf(selectedEnemy) for each. Pay extra attention to case.
  indexOf(t) in Array one: 4
  indexOf(t) in Array thirteen: 0
  indexOf(t) in Array twenty: 1

  EIGHTH: If any of these indexOf values === -1, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  None of the indexOf values are -1.

  NINTH: Go through the listed arrays and list only the numbers contained in those three arrays (i.e., remove the letters).
  Array one: [2, 1, 9, 4, 8, 7]
  Array thirteen: [7, 9, 6]
  Array twenty: [9, 3, 2, 7, 1]

  TENTH: Concatenate the three lists into a single list.
  [2, 1, 9, 4, 8, 7, 7, 9, 6, 9, 3, 2, 7, 1]

  ELEVENTH: Iterate through the concatenated list and REMOVE every LETTER, if there are no letters, then just re-output the list of numbers.
  [2, 1, 9, 4, 8, 7, 7, 9, 6, 9, 3, 2, 7, 1]

  TWELFTH: Dedupe this list.
  [2, 1, 9, 4, 8, 7, 6, 3]

  THIRTEENTH: Sort this list.
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length = 8

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  The missing number between 1 and 9 is 5.

  SIXTEENTH: Re-output the indexOf values from the SEVENTH step.
  indexOf(t) in Array one: 4
  indexOf(t) in Array thirteen: 0
  indexOf(t) in Array twenty: 1

  SEVENTEENTH: For each of the three arrays from earlier, replace the letter at the indexOf value with the missing number.
  Array one: [2, 1, s, 9, 5, Z, 4, 8, 7]
  Array thirteen: [5, I, 7, 9, i, C, f, W, 6]
  Array twenty: [9, 5, Z, 3, I, 2, M, 7, 1]

  EIGHTEENTH: It's time to update the game state. The first thing you are required to do is come up with a unique name for the game state. Output the name. After you output the new game state name, output "let one =" on the next line. Then carefully finish printing the new game state, making sure to be precise and careful. You want it to be exactly like the previous game state except for the new updates that occurred this KICK SWEEP! Remember to include the new remainingEnemies. The reason you must always list everything out in full is that I'm copy-pasting your most recent response into a new chat, so if you fail to list it out in full, you'll irrevocably lose the game state information and necessarily fail at the game.

  let selectedEnemyIndex = 5

  THIRD: Select the enemy letter to attack. Always select remainingEnemies[selectedEnemyIndex]. If selectedEnemyIndex >= remainingEnemies.length, then output "let selectedEnemyIndex = 0", and select the enemy letter at remainingEnemies[0].
  The selected enemy letter is 'y'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 6

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking. You'll find one array between arrays one and nine (inclusive), one array between ten and eighteen (inclusive), and one array between nineteen and twenty-seven (inclusive). Always list every element (every number and letter) of the three arrays found during this step.

  SIXTH: If you don't have exactly three arrays (e.g., you have two arrays or four arrays), immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  We have exactly three arrays.

  indexOf(y) in Array two: 6
  indexOf(y) in Array fifteen: 1
  indexOf(y) in Array twentyOne: 3

  EIGHTH: If any of these indexOf values === -1, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  None of the indexOf values are -1.

  NINTH: Go through the listed arrays and list only the numbers contained in those three arrays (i.e., remove the letters).
  Array two: [8, 3, 2, 9, 1]
  Array fifteen: [4, 6, 7, 1, 9]
  Array twentyOne: [4, 8, 7, 9, 1]

  TENTH: Concatenate the three lists into a single list.
  [8, 3, 2, 9, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 9, 4, 8, 7, 9, 1]

  ELEVENTH: Iterate through the concatenated list and REMOVE every LETTER, if there are no letters, then just re-output the list of numbers.
  [8, 3, 2, 9, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 9, 4, 8, 7, 9, 1]

  TWELFTH: Dedupe this list.
  [8, 3, 2, 9, 1, 4, 6, 7]

  THIRTEENTH: Sort this list.
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length = 8

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  The missing number is 5.

  SIXTEENTH: Re-output the indexOf values from the SEVENTH step.
  indexOf(y) in Array two: 6
  indexOf(y) in Array fifteen: 1
  indexOf(y) in Array twentyOne: 3

  SEVENTEENTH: For each of the three arrays from earlier, replace the letter at the indexOf value with the missing number.
  Array two: [8, o, p, 3, I, 2, 5, 9, 1]
  Array fifteen: [4, 5, S, 6, j, 7, K, U, h]
  Array twentyOne: [4, 8, 7, 5, 9, 1, S, k, Y]

  EIGHTEENTH: It's time to update the game state. The first thing you are required to do is come up with a unique name for the game state. Output the name. After you output the new game state name, output "let one =" on the next line. Then carefully finish printing the new game state, making sure to be precise and careful. You want it to be exactly like the previous game state except for the new updates that occurred this KICK SWEEP! Remember to include the new remainingEnemies. The reason you must always list everything out in full is that I'm copy-pasting your most recent response into a new chat, so if you fail to list it out in full, you'll irrevocably lose the game state information and necessarily fail at the game.

  let selectedEnemyIndex = 6

  THIRD: Select the enemy letter to attack. Always select remainingEnemies[selectedEnemyIndex]. If selectedEnemyIndex >= remainingEnemies.length, then output "let selectedEnemyIndex = 0", and select the enemy letter at remainingEnemies[0].
  The selected enemy letter is 'z'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 7

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking. You'll find one array between arrays one and nine (inclusive), one array between ten and eighteen (inclusive), and one array between nineteen and twenty-seven (inclusive). Always list every element (every number and letter) of the three arrays found during this step.

  We have exactly three arrays.

  SEVENTH: Go through the listed arrays and output indexOf(selectedEnemy) for each. Pay extra attention to case.
  indexOf(z) in Array three: 1
  indexOf(z) in Array ten: 2
  indexOf(z) in Array nineteen: 7

  EIGHTH: If any of these indexOf values === -1, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  None of the indexOf values are -1.

  NINTH: Go through the listed arrays and list only the numbers contained in those three arrays (i.e., remove the letters).
  Array three: [9, 5, 7, 1, 1, 9]
  Array ten: [1, 6, 3, 1, 9]
  Array nineteen: [2, 1, 8, 9, 5]

  TENTH: Concatenate the three lists into a single list.
  [9, 5, 7, 1, 1, 9, 1, 6, 3, 1, 9, 2, 1, 8, 9, 5]

  ELEVENTH: Iterate through the concatenated list and REMOVE every LETTER, if there are no letters, then just re-output the list of numbers.
  [9, 5, 7, 1, 1, 9, 1, 6, 3, 1, 9, 2, 1, 8, 9, 5]

  TWELFTH: Dedupe this list.
  [9, 5, 7, 1, 6, 3, 2, 8]

  THIRTEENTH: Sort this list.
  [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length = 8

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  The missing number is 4.

  SIXTEENTH: Re-output the indexOf values from the SEVENTH step.
  indexOf(z) in Array three: 1
  indexOf(z) in Array ten: 2
  indexOf(z) in Array nineteen: 7

  SEVENTEENTH: For each of the three arrays from earlier, replace the letter at the indexOf value with the missing number.
  Array three: [9, 4, 5, M, 7, 1, S, k, Y]
  Array ten: [1, o, 4, V, 6, q, 3, O, H]
  Array nineteen: [2, 1, s, 8, o, p, 9, 4, 5]

  EIGHTEENTH: It's time to update the game state. The first thing you are required to do is come up with a unique name for the game state. Output the name. After you output the new game state name, output "let one =" on the next line. Then carefully finish printing the new game state, making sure to be precise and careful.

  THIRD: Select the enemy letter to attack. Always select remainingEnemies[selectedEnemyIndex]. If selectedEnemyIndex >= remainingEnemies.length, then output "let selectedEnemyIndex = 0", and select the enemy letter at remainingEnemies[0].
  The selected enemy letter is 'S'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 8

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking. You'll find one array between arrays one and nine (inclusive), one array between ten and eighteen (inclusive), and one array between nineteen and twenty-seven (inclusive).

  indexOf(S) in Array twentyOne: 6

  EIGHTH: If any of these indexOf values === -1, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  None of the indexOf values are -1.

  NINTH: Go through the listed arrays and list only the numbers contained in those three arrays (i.e., remove the letters).
  Array one: [2, 1, 9, 5, 4, 8, 7]
  Array three: [9, 4, 5, 7, 1, 1, 9]

  TWELFTH: Dedupe this list.
  [2, 1, 9, 5, 4, 8, 7]

  THIRTEENTH: Sort this list.
  [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length = 7

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing.

  let selectedEnemyIndex = 8

  THIRD: Select the enemy letter to attack. Always select remainingEnemies[selectedEnemyIndex]. If selectedEnemyIndex >= remainingEnemies.length, then output "let selectedEnemyIndex = 0", and select the enemy letter at remainingEnemies[0].
  The selected enemy letter is 'k'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 9

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking. You'll find one array between arrays one and nine (inclusive), one array between ten and eighteen (inclusive), and one array between nineteen and twenty-seven (inclusive). Always list every element (every number and letter) of the three arrays found during this step.
  Array three: [9, 4, 5, M, 7, 1, S, k, Y]
  Array twentyOne: [4, 8, 7, 5, 9, 1, S, k, Y]
  Array sixteen: [8, 9, k, 1, g, m, u, 2, E]

  SIXTH: If you don't have exactly three arrays (e.g., you have two arrays or four arrays), immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  We have exactly three arrays.

  SEVENTH: Go through the listed arrays and output indexOf(selectedEnemy) for each. Pay extra attention to case.
  indexOf(k) in Array three: 7
  indexOf(k) in Array twentyOne: 7
  indexOf(k) in Array sixteen: 2

  EIGHTH: If any of these indexOf values === -1, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  None of the indexOf values are -1.

  NINTH: Go through the listed arrays and list only the numbers contained in those three arrays (i.e., remove the letters).
  Array three: [9, 4, 5, 7, 1, 1, 9]
  Array twentyOne: [4, 8, 7, 5, 9, 1, 1, 9]
  Array sixteen: [8, 9, 1, 1, 2, 9]

  TENTH: Concatenate the three lists into a single list.
  [9, 4, 5, 7, 1, 1, 9, 4, 8, 7, 5, 9, 1, 1, 9, 8, 9, 1, 1, 2, 9]

  ELEVENTH: Iterate through the concatenated list and REMOVE every LETTER, if there are no letters, then just re-output the list of numbers.
  [9, 4, 5, 7, 1, 1, 9, 4, 8, 7, 5, 9, 1, 1, 9, 8, 9, 1, 1, 2, 9]

  TWELFTH: Dedupe this list.
  [9, 4, 5, 7, 1, 8, 2]

  THIRTEENTH: Sort this list.
  [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length = 7

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  CRITICAL HIT ABORTED!

  THIRD: Select the enemy letter to attack. Always select remainingEnemies[selectedEnemyIndex]. If selectedEnemyIndex >= remainingEnemies.length, then output "let selectedEnemyIndex = 0", and select the enemy letter at remainingEnemies[0].
  The selected enemy letter is 'F'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 10

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking. You'll find one array between arrays one and nine (inclusive), one array between ten and eighteen (inclusive), and one array between nineteen and twenty-seven (inclusive).

  EIGHTH: If any of these indexOf values === -1, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  None of the indexOf values are -1.

  NINTH: Go through the listed arrays and list only the numbers contained in those three arrays (i.e., remove the letters).
  Array four: [7, 5, 9, 6, 1]
  Array eighteen: [2, 8, 9, 5, 4, 7, 1]
  Array twentyTwo: [7, 5, 6, 4, 1]

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  There is no missing number between 1 and 9.

  SIXTEENTH: Re-output the indexOf values from the SEVENTH step.
  indexOf(F) in Array four: 0
  indexOf(F) in Array eighteen: 3
  indexOf(F) in Array twentyTwo: 0

  SEVENTEENTH: For each of the three arrays from earlier, replace the letter at the indexOf value with the missing number.
  Since there is no missing number, we cannot replace the letter 'F' with a number.

  EIGHTEENTH: It's time to update the game state. The first thing you are required to do is come up with a unique name for the game state. Output the name. After you output the new game state name, output "let one =" on the next line. Then carefully finish printing the new game state, making sure to be precise and careful. You want it to be exactly like the previous game state except for the new updates that occurred this KICK SWEEP! Remember to include the new remainingEnemies. The reason you must always list everything out in full is that I'm copy-pasting your most recent response into a new chat, so if you fail to list it out in full, you'll irrevocably lose the game state information and necessarily fail at the game.

  Since we could not replace the letter 'F' with a number, the game state remains the same as the GOLD GAME STATE.
