  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 17

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking.

  indexOf(j) in Array five: 6
  indexOf(j) in Array fifteen: 4
  indexOf(j) in Array twentyFour: 3

  EIGHTH: If any of these indexOf values === -1, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  All indexOf values are valid.

  NINTH: Go through the listed arrays and list only the numbers contained in those three arrays (i.e., remove the letters).
  Array five: [5, 6, 3, 2]
  Array fifteen: [4, 5, 6, 7, h]
  Array twentyFour: [6, 1, 2, 7, m, d]

  TENTH: Concatenate the three lists into a single list.
  [5, 6, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, h, 6, 1, 2, 7, m, d]

  ELEVENTH: Iterate through the concatenated list and REMOVE every LETTER, if there are no letters, then just re-output the list of numbers.
  [5, 6, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 6, 1, 2, 7]

  TWELFTH: Dedupe this list.
  [5, 6, 3, 2, 4, 7, 1]

  THIRTEENTH: Sort this list.
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length = 7

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.

  let selectedEnemyIndex = 19

  THIRD: Select the enemy letter to attack. Always select remainingEnemies[selectedEnemyIndex]. If selectedEnemyIndex >= remainingEnemies.length, then output "let selectedEnemyIndex = 0", and select the enemy letter at remainingEnemies[0].
  The selected enemy letter is 'B'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 20

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking. You'll find one array between arrays one and nine (inclusive), one array between ten and eighteen (inclusive), and one array between nineteen and twenty-seven (inclusive).

  EIGHTH: If any of these indexOf values === -1, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  All indexOf values are valid.

  NINTH: Go through the listed arrays and list only the numbers contained in those three arrays (i.e., remove the letters).
  Array six: [4, 1, 6, 7, m, d]
  Array fourteen: [2, 1, w, 3, 7, A, 5]
  Array twentyThree: [5, 9, w, b, i, 3, 6, C]

  TENTH: Concatenate the three lists into a single list.
  [4, 1, 6, 7, m, d, 2, 1, w, 3, 7, A, 5, 5, 9, w, b, i, 3, 6, C]

  ELEVENTH: Iterate through the concatenated list and REMOVE every LETTER, if there are no letters, then just re-output the list of numbers.
  [4, 1, 6, 7, 2, 1, 3, 7, 5, 5, 9, 3, 6]

  TWELFTH: Dedupe this list.
  [4, 1, 6, 7, 2, 3, 5, 9]

  THIRTEENTH: Sort this list.
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length = 8

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  The missing number is 8.

  SIXTEENTH: Re-output the indexOf values from the SEVENTH step.
  indexOf(B) in Array six: 5
  indexOf(B) in Array fourteen: 5
  indexOf(B) in Array twentyThree: 8

  SEVENTEENTH: For each of the three arrays from earlier, replace the letter at the indexOf value with the missing number.
  Array six: [4, q, 1, 6, C, 8, 7, m, d]
  Array fourteen: [Z, 2, 1, w, 3, 8, 7, A, 5]
  Array twentyThree: [5, 9, w, b, i, 3, 6, C, 8]

  EIGHTEENTH: It's time to update the game state. The first thing you are required to do is come up with a unique name for the game state. Output the name. After you output the new game state name, output "let one =" on the next line. Then carefully finish printing the new game state, making sure to be precise and careful. You want it to be exactly like the previous game state except for the new updates that occurred this KICK SWEEP! Remember to include the new remainingEnemies. The reason you must always list everything out in full is that I'm copy-pasting your most recent response into a new chat, so if you fail to list it out in full, you'll irrevocably lose the game state information and necessarily fail at the game.

  THIRD: Select the enemy letter to attack. Always select remainingEnemies[selectedEnemyIndex]. If selectedEnemyIndex >= remainingEnemies.length, then output "let selectedEnemyIndex = 0", and select the enemy letter at remainingEnemies[0].
  The selected enemy letter is 'm'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 21

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking. You'll find one array between arrays one and nine (inclusive), one array between ten and eighteen (inclusive), and one array between nineteen and twenty-seven (inclusive).

  [1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length = 7

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing.

  let selectedEnemyIndex = 21

  THIRD: Select the enemy letter to attack. Always select remainingEnemies[selectedEnemyIndex]. If selectedEnemyIndex >= remainingEnemies.length, then output "let selectedEnemyIndex = 0", and select the enemy letter at remainingEnemies[0].
  The selected enemy letter is 'd'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 22

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking. You'll find one array between arrays one and nine (inclusive), one array between ten and eighteen (inclusive), and one array between nineteen and twenty-seven (inclusive). Always list every element (every number and letter) of the three arrays found during this step.
  Array six: [4, q, 1, 6, C, 8, 7, m, d]

  indexOf(d) in Array six: 8
  indexOf(d) in Array seventeen: 5
  indexOf(d) in Array twentyFour: 8

  EIGHTH: If any of these indexOf values === -1, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  All indexOf values are valid.

  NINTH: Go through the listed arrays and list only the numbers contained in those three arrays (i.e., remove the letters).
  Array six: [4, 1, 6, 8, 7]
  Array seventeen: [7, 1, 2, 6, 9]
  Array twentyFour: [6, 1, 4, 2, 7]

  TENTH: Concatenate the three lists into a single list.
  [4, 1, 6, 8, 7, 7, 1, 2, 6, 9, 6, 1, 4, 2, 7]

  ELEVENTH: Iterate through the concatenated list and REMOVE every LETTER, if there are no letters, then just re-output the list of numbers.
  [4, 1, 6, 8, 7, 7, 1, 2, 6, 9, 6, 1, 4, 2, 7]

  TWELFTH: Dedupe this list.
  [4, 1, 6, 8, 7, 2, 9]

  THIRTEENTH: Sort this list.
  [1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length = 7

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  CRITICAL HIT ABORTED!

  let selectedEnemyIndex = 24

  THIRD: Select the enemy letter to attack. Always select remainingEnemies[selectedEnemyIndex]. If selectedEnemyIndex >= remainingEnemies.length, then output "let selectedEnemyIndex = 0", and select the enemy letter at remainingEnemies[0].
  The selected enemy letter is 'u'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 25

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking. You'll find one array between arrays one and nine (inclusive), one array between ten and eighteen (inclusive), and one array between nineteen and twenty-seven (inclusive). Always list every element (every number and letter) of the three arrays found during this step.
  Array seven: [6, 3, 9, R, f, 7, K, u, n]
  Array sixteen: [8, 9, k, 1, 4, m, u, 2, E]
  Array twentySeven: [K, u, n, U, 2, 6, h, E, 9]

  SEVENTH: Go through the listed arrays and output indexOf(selectedEnemy) for each. Pay extra attention to case.
  indexOf(u) in Array seven: 7
  indexOf(u) in Array sixteen: 6
  indexOf(u) in Array twentySeven: 1

  EIGHTH: If any of these indexOf values === -1, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  All indexOf values are valid.

  NINTH: Go through the listed arrays and list only the numbers contained in those three arrays (i.e., remove the letters).
  Array seven: [6, 3, 9, 7]
  Array sixteen: [8, 9, 1, 4, 2]
  Array twentySeven: [2, 6, 9]

  TENTH: Concatenate the three lists into a single list.
  [6, 3, 9, 7, 8, 9, 1, 4, 2, 2, 6, 9]

  ELEVENTH: Iterate through the concatenated list and REMOVE every LETTER, if there are no letters, then just re-output the list of numbers.
  [6, 3, 9, 7, 8, 9, 1, 4, 2, 2, 6, 9]

  TWELFTH: Dedupe this list.
  [6, 3, 9, 7, 8, 1, 4, 2]

  THIRTEENTH: Sort this list.
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length = 8

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  The missing number is 5.

  SIXTEENTH: Re-output the indexOf values from the SEVENTH step.
  indexOf(u) in Array seven: 7
  indexOf(u) in Array sixteen: 6
  indexOf(u) in Array twentySeven: 1

  SEVENTEENTH: For each of the three arrays from earlier, replace the letter at the indexOf value with the missing number.
  Array seven: [6, 3, 9, R, f, 7, K, 5, n]
  Array sixteen: [8, 9, k, 1, 4, m, 5, 2, E]
  Array twentySeven: [K, 5, n, U, 2, 6, h, E, 9]

  EIGHTEENTH: It's time to update the game state. The first thing you are required to do is come up with a unique name for the game state. Output the name. After you output the new game state name, output "let one =" on the next line. Then carefully finish printing the new game state, making sure to be precise and careful. You want it to be exactly like the previous game state except for the new updates that occurred this KICK SWEEP! Remember to include the new remainingEnemies. The reason you must always list everything out in full is that I'm copy-pasting your most recent response into a new chat, so if you fail to list it out in full, you'll irrevocably lose the game state information and necessarily fail at the game.

  THIRD: Select the enemy letter to attack. Always select remainingEnemies[selectedEnemyIndex]. If selectedEnemyIndex >= remainingEnemies.length, then output "let selectedEnemyIndex = 0", and select the enemy letter at remainingEnemies[0].
  The selected enemy letter is 'n'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 26

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking. You'll find one array between arrays one and nine (inclusive), one array between ten and eighteen (inclusive), and one array between nineteen and twenty-seven (inclusive).

  indexOf(n) in Array seven: 8
  indexOf(n) in Array seventeen: 6
  indexOf(n) in Array twentySeven: 2

  EIGHTH: If any of these indexOf values === -1, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  All indexOf values are valid.

  NINTH: Go through the listed arrays and list only the numbers contained in those three arrays (i.e., remove the letters).
  Array seven: [6, 3, 9, 7, 5]
  Array seventeen: [7, 1, 2, 6, 9]
  Array twentySeven: [5, 2, 6, 9]

  TENTH: Concatenate the three lists into a single list.
  [6, 3, 9, 7, 5, 7, 1, 2, 6, 9, 5, 2, 6, 9]

  ELEVENTH: Iterate through the concatenated list and REMOVE every LETTER, if there are no letters, then just re-output the list of numbers.
  [6, 3, 9, 7, 5, 7, 1, 2, 6, 9, 5, 2, 6, 9]

  TWELFTH: Dedupe this list.
  [6, 3, 9, 7, 5, 1, 2]

  THIRTEENTH: Sort this list.
  [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length = 7

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.

  let selectedEnemyIndex = 1

  THIRD: Select the enemy letter to attack. Always select remainingEnemies[selectedEnemyIndex]. If selectedEnemyIndex >= remainingEnemies.length, then output "let selectedEnemyIndex = 0", and select the enemy letter at remainingEnemies[0].
  The selected enemy letter is 'Z'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 2

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking. You'll find one array between arrays one and nine (inclusive), one array between ten and eighteen (inclusive), and one array between nineteen and twenty-seven (inclusive). Always list every element (every number and letter) of the three arrays found during this step.

  SEVENTH: Go through the listed arrays and output indexOf(selectedEnemy) for each. Pay extra attention to case.
  indexOf(Z) in Array one: 5
  indexOf(Z) in Array fourteen: 0
  indexOf(Z) in Array twenty: 2

  EIGHTH: If any of these indexOf values === -1, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  All indexOf values are valid.

  NINTH: Go through the listed arrays and list only the numbers contained in those three arrays (i.e., remove the letters).
  Array one: [2, 1, 9, 5, 4, 8, 7]
  Array fourteen: [2, 1, 3, 8, 7, 5]
  Array twenty: [9, 5, 3, 2, 7, 1]

  TENTH: Concatenate the three lists into a single list.
  [2, 1, 9, 5, 4, 8, 7, 2, 1, 3, 8, 7, 5, 9, 5, 3, 2, 7, 1]

  ELEVENTH: Iterate through the concatenated list and REMOVE every LETTER, if there are no letters, then just re-output the list of numbers.
  [2, 1, 9, 5, 4, 8, 7, 2, 1, 3, 8, 7, 5, 9, 5, 3, 2, 7, 1]

  TWELFTH: Dedupe this list.
  [2, 1, 9, 5, 4, 8, 7, 3]

  THIRTEENTH: Sort this list.
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length = 8

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  The missing number is 6.

  SIXTEENTH: Re-output the indexOf values from the SEVENTH step.
  indexOf(Z) in Array one: 5
  indexOf(Z) in Array fourteen: 0
  indexOf(Z) in Array twenty: 2

  SEVENTEENTH: For each of the three arrays from earlier, replace the letter at the indexOf value with the missing number.
  Array one: [2, 1, s, 9, 5, 6, 4, 8, 7]
  Array fourteen: [6, 2, 1, w, 3, 8, 7, A, 5]
  Array twenty: [9, 5, 6, 3, I, 2, M, 7, 1]

  EIGHTEENTH: It's time to update the game state. The first thing you are required to do is come up with a unique name for the game state. Output the name. After you output the new game state name, output "let one =" on the next line. Then carefully finish printing the new game state, making sure to be precise and careful. You want it to be exactly like the previous game state except for the new updates that occurred this KICK SWEEP! Remember to include the new remainingEnemies. The reason you must always list everything out in full is that I'm copy-pasting your most recent response into a new chat, so if you fail to list it out in full, you'll irrevocably lose the game state information and necessarily fail at the game.

  let selectedEnemyIndex = 2

  THIRD: Select the enemy letter to attack. Always select remainingEnemies[selectedEnemyIndex]. If selectedEnemyIndex >= remainingEnemies.length, then output "let selectedEnemyIndex = 0", and select the enemy letter at remainingEnemies[0].
  The selected enemy letter is 'o'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 3

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking. You'll find one array between arrays one and nine (inclusive), one array between ten and eighteen (inclusive), and one array between nineteen and twenty-seven (inclusive). Always list every element (every number and letter) of the three arrays found during this step.

  indexOf(o) in Array two: 1
  indexOf(o) in Array ten: 1
  indexOf(o) in Array nineteen: 4

  EIGHTH: If any of these indexOf values === -1, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  All indexOf values are valid.

  NINTH: Go through the listed arrays and list only the numbers contained in those three arrays (i.e., remove the letters).
  Array two: [8, 3, 2, 5, 9, 1]
  Array ten: [1, 4, 6, 3, 9]
  Array nineteen: [2, 1, 8, 9, 4, 5]

  TENTH: Concatenate the three lists into a single list.
  [8, 3, 2, 5, 9, 1, 1, 4, 6, 3, 9, 2, 1, 8, 9, 4, 5]

  ELEVENTH: Iterate through the concatenated list and REMOVE every LETTER, if there are no letters, then just re-output the list of numbers.
  [8, 3, 2, 5, 9, 1, 1, 4, 6, 3, 9, 2, 1, 8, 9, 4, 5]

  TWELFTH: Dedupe this list.
  [8, 3, 2, 5, 9, 1, 4, 6]

  THIRTEENTH: Sort this list.
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length = 8

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  The missing number is 7.

  SIXTEENTH: Re-output the indexOf values from the SEVENTH step.
  indexOf(o) in Array two: 1
  indexOf(o) in Array ten: 1
  indexOf(o) in Array nineteen: 4

  SEVENTEENTH: For each of the three arrays from earlier, replace the letter at the indexOf value with the missing number.
  Array two: [8, 7, p, 3, I, 2, 5, 9, 1]
  Array ten: [1, 7, 4, V, 6, q, 3, O, H]
  Array nineteen: [2, 1, s, 8, 7, p, 9, 4, 5]

  EIGHTEENTH: It's time to update the game state. The first thing you are required to do is come up with a unique name for the game state. Output the name. After you output the new game state name, output "let one =" on the next line. Then carefully finish printing the new game state, making sure to be precise and careful. You want it to be exactly like the previous game state except for the new updates that occurred this KICK SWEEP! Remember to include the new remainingEnemies.

  let selectedEnemyIndex = 3

  THIRD: Select the enemy letter to attack. Always select remainingEnemies[selectedEnemyIndex]. If selectedEnemyIndex >= remainingEnemies.length, then output "let selectedEnemyIndex = 0", and select the enemy letter at remainingEnemies[0].
  The selected enemy letter is 'I'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 4

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking. You'll find one array between arrays one and nine (inclusive), one array between ten and eighteen (inclusive), and one array between nineteen and twenty-seven (inclusive). Always list every element (every number and letter) of the three arrays found during this step.

  SEVENTH: Go through the listed arrays and output indexOf(selectedEnemy) for each. Pay extra attention to case.
  indexOf(I) in Array two: 4
  indexOf(I) in Array thirteen: 1
  indexOf(I) in Array twenty: 4

  EIGHTH: If any of these indexOf values === -1, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  All indexOf values are valid.

  NINTH: Go through the listed arrays and list only the numbers contained in those three arrays (i.e., remove the letters).
  Array two: [8, 7, 3, 2, 5, 9, 1]
  Array thirteen: [5, 7, 9, 6, 6]
  Array twenty: [9, 5, 6, 3, 2, 7, 1]

  TENTH: Concatenate the three lists into a single list.
  [8, 7, 3, 2, 5, 9, 1, 5, 7, 9, 6, 6, 9, 5, 6, 3, 2, 7, 1]

  ELEVENTH: Iterate through the concatenated list and REMOVE every LETTER, if there are no letters, then just re-output the list of numbers.
  [8, 7, 3, 2, 5, 9, 1, 5, 7, 9, 6, 6, 9, 5, 6, 3, 2, 7, 1]

  TWELFTH: Dedupe this list.
  [8, 7, 3, 2, 5, 9, 1, 6]

  THIRTEENTH: Sort this list.
  [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length = 8

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  The missing number is 4.

  SIXTEENTH: Re-output the indexOf values from the SEVENTH step.
  indexOf(I) in Array two: 4
  indexOf(I) in Array thirteen: 1
  indexOf(I) in Array twenty: 4

  SEVENTEENTH: For each of the three arrays from earlier, replace the letter at the indexOf value with the missing number.
  Array two: [8, 7, p, 3, 4, 2, 5, 9, 1]
  Array thirteen: [5, 4, 7, 9, i, C, f, W, 6]
  Array twenty: [9, 5, 6, 3, 4, 2, M, 7, 1]

  EIGHTEENTH: It's time to update the game state. The first thing you are required to do is come up with a unique name for the game state. Output the name. After you output the new game state name, output "let one =" on the next line. Then carefully finish printing the new game state, making sure to be precise and careful.

  THIRTEENTH: Sort this list.
  [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, K, U, h]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length = 10

  let selectedEnemyIndex = 5

  THIRD: Select the enemy letter to attack. Always select remainingEnemies[selectedEnemyIndex]. If selectedEnemyIndex >= remainingEnemies.length, then output "let selectedEnemyIndex = 0", and select the enemy letter at remainingEnemies[0].
  The selected enemy letter is 'k'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 6

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking. You'll find one array between arrays one and nine (inclusive), one array between ten and eighteen (inclusive), and one array between nineteen and twenty-seven (inclusive). Always list every element (every number and letter) of the three arrays found during this step.
  Array three: [9, 4, 5, M, 7, 1, S, k, Y]

  indexOf(k) in Array three: 7
  indexOf(k) in Array twentyOne: 7
  indexOf(k) in Array sixteen: 2

  EIGHTH: If any of these indexOf values === -1, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  All indexOf values are valid.

  NINTH: Go through the listed arrays and list only the numbers contained in those three arrays (i.e., remove the letters).
  Array three: [9, 4, 5, 7, 1, S, Y]
  Array twentyOne: [4, 8, 7, 5, 9, 1, S, Y]
  Array sixteen: [8, 9, 1, 4, m, 5, 2, E]

  TENTH: Concatenate the three lists into a single list.
  [9, 4, 5, 7, 1, S, Y, 4, 8, 7, 5, 9, 1, S, Y, 8, 9, 1, 4, m, 5, 2, E]

  ELEVENTH: Iterate through the concatenated list and REMOVE every LETTER, if there are no letters, then just re-output the list of numbers.
  [9, 4, 5, 7, 1, Y, 4, 8, 7, 5, 9, 1, Y, 8, 9, 1, 4, 5, 2, E]

  TWELFTH: Dedupe this list.
  [9, 4, 5, 7, 1, Y, 8, 2, E]

  THIRTEENTH: Sort this list.
  [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, E, Y]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length = 9

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  CRITICAL HIT ABORTED!

  THIRD: Select the enemy letter to attack. Always select remainingEnemies[selectedEnemyIndex]. If selectedEnemyIndex >= remainingEnemies.length, then output "let selectedEnemyIndex = 0", and select the enemy letter at remainingEnemies[0].
  The selected enemy letter is 'w'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 9

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking. You'll find one array between arrays one and nine (inclusive), one array between ten and eighteen (inclusive), and one array between nineteen and twenty-seven (inclusive).

  indexOf(w) in Array four: 5
  indexOf(w) in Array twentyThree: 2
  indexOf(w) in Array fourteen: 3

  EIGHTH: If any of these indexOf values === -1, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  All indexOf values are valid.

  NINTH: Go through the listed arrays and list only the numbers contained in those three arrays (i.e., remove the letters).
  Array four: [7, 5, 9, 6, 1, e]
  Array twentyThree: [5, 9, b, i, 3, 6, C, 8]
  Array fourteen: [6, 2, 1, 3, 8, 7, A, 5]

  TENTH: Concatenate the three lists into a single list.
  [7, 5, 9, 6, 1, e, 5, 9, b, i, 3, 6, C, 8, 6, 2, 1, 3, 8, 7, A, 5]

  [7, 5, 9, 6, 1, 5, 9, 3, 6, 8, 6, 2, 1, 3, 8, 7, 5]

  TWELFTH: Dedupe this list.
  [7, 5, 9, 6, 1, 3, 8, 2]

  THIRTEENTH: Sort this list.
  [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length = 8

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  The missing number is 4.

  SIXTEENTH: Re-output the indexOf values from the SEVENTH step.
  indexOf(w) in Array four: 5
  indexOf(w) in Array twentyThree: 2
  indexOf(w) in Array fourteen: 3

  SEVENTEENTH: For each of the three arrays from earlier, replace the letter at the indexOf value with the missing number.
  Array four: [F, V, 7, 5, 9, 4, 6, 1, e]
  Array twentyThree: [5, 9, 4, b, i, 3, 6, C, 8]
  Array fourteen: [6, 2, 1, 4, 3, 8, 7, A, 5]

  EIGHTEENTH: It's time to update the game state. The first thing you are required to do is come up with a unique name for the game state. Output the name. After you output the new game state name, output "let one =" on the next line. Then carefully finish printing the new game state, making sure to be precise and careful. You want it to be exactly like the previous game state except for the new updates that occurred this KICK SWEEP! Remember to include the new remainingEnemies. The reason you must always list everything out in full is that I'm copy-pasting your most recent response into a new chat, so if you fail to list it out in full, you'll irrevocably lose the game state information and necessarily fail at the game.

  let selectedEnemyIndex = 9

  THIRD: Select the enemy letter to attack. Always select remainingEnemies[selectedEnemyIndex]. If selectedEnemyIndex >= remainingEnemies.length, then output "let selectedEnemyIndex = 0", and select the enemy letter at remainingEnemies[0].
  The selected enemy letter is 'e'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 10

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking. You'll find one array between arrays one and nine (inclusive), one array between ten and eighteen (inclusive), and one array between nineteen and twenty-seven (inclusive). Always list every element (every number and letter) of the three arrays found during this step.

  indexOf(e) in Array four: 8
  indexOf(e) in Array twentyFour: 2
  indexOf(e) in Array seventeen: 3

  EIGHTH: If any of these indexOf values === -1, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  All indexOf values are valid.

  NINTH: Go through the listed arrays and list only the numbers contained in those three arrays (i.e., remove the letters).
  Array four: [7, 5, 9, 4, 6, 1]
  Array twentyFour: [6, 1, j, 4, 2, 7, m, d]
  Array seventeen: [7, 1, 3, 2, d, n, 6, 9]

  TENTH: Concatenate the three lists into a single list.
  [7, 5, 9, 4, 6, 1, 6, 1, j, 4, 2, 7, m, d, 7, 1, 3, 2, d, n, 6, 9]

  [7, 5, 9, 4, 6, 1, 6, 1, 4, 2, 7, 7, 1, 3, 2, 6, 9]

  TWELFTH: Dedupe this list.
  [7, 5, 9, 4, 6, 1, 2, 3]

  THIRTEENTH: Sort this list.
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length = 8

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  The missing number is 8.

  SIXTEENTH: Re-output the indexOf values from the SEVENTH step.
  indexOf(e) in Array four: 8
  indexOf(e) in Array twentyFour: 2
  indexOf(e) in Array seventeen: 3

  SEVENTEENTH: For each of the three arrays from earlier, replace the letter at the indexOf value with the missing number.
  Array four: [F, V, 7, 5, 9, 4, 6, 1, 8]
  Array twentyFour: [6, 1, 8, j, 4, 2, 7, m, d]
  Array seventeen: [7, 1, 3, 8, 2, d, n, 6, 9]

  EIGHTEENTH: It's time to update the game state. The first thing you are required to do is come up with a unique name for the game state. Output the name. After you output the new game state name, output "let one =" on the next line. Then carefully finish printing the new game state, making sure to be precise and careful.

  let selectedEnemyIndex = 10

  THIRD: Select the enemy letter to attack. Always select remainingEnemies[selectedEnemyIndex]. If selectedEnemyIndex >= remainingEnemies.length, then output "let selectedEnemyIndex = 0", and select the enemy letter at remainingEnemies[0].
  The selected enemy letter is 'i'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 11

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking. You'll find one array between arrays one and nine (inclusive), one array between ten and eighteen (inclusive), and one array between nineteen and twenty-seven (inclusive). Always list every element (every number and letter) of the three arrays found during this step.

  indexOf(i) in Array five: 4
  indexOf(i) in Array thirteen: 4
  indexOf(i) in Array twentyThree: 4

  EIGHTH: If any of these indexOf values === -1, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  All indexOf values are valid.

  NINTH: Go through the listed arrays and list only the numbers contained in those three arrays (i.e., remove the letters).
  Array five: [5, 6, 3, 4, 2]
  Array thirteen: [5, 4, 7, 9, C, f, W, 6]
  Array twentyThree: [5, 9, 4, 3, 6, C, 8]

  TENTH: Concatenate the three lists into a single list.
  [5, 6, 3, 4, 2, 5, 4, 7, 9, C, f, W, 6, 5, 9, 4, 3, 6, C, 8]

  [5, 6, 3, 4, 2, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6, 5, 9, 4, 3, 6, 8]

  TWELFTH: Dedupe this list.
  [5, 6, 3, 4, 2, 7, 9, 8]

  THIRTEENTH: Sort this list.
  [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length = 8

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  The missing number is 1.

  SIXTEENTH: Re-output the indexOf values from the SEVENTH step.
  indexOf(i) in Array five: 4
  indexOf(i) in Array thirteen: 4
  indexOf(i) in Array twentyThree: 4

  SEVENTEENTH: For each of the three arrays from earlier, replace the letter at the indexOf value with the missing number.
  Array five: [5, 6, G, b, 1, 3, j, 4, 2]
  Array thirteen: [5, 4, 7, 9, 1, C, f, W, 6]
  Array twentyThree: [5, 9, 4, b, 1, 3, 6, C, 8]

  EIGHTEENTH: It's time to update the game state. The first thing you are required to do is come up with a unique name for the game state. Output the name. After you output the new game state name, output "let one =" on the next line. Then carefully finish printing the new game state, making sure to be precise and careful.

  THIRD: Select the enemy letter to attack. Always select remainingEnemies[selectedEnemyIndex]. If selectedEnemyIndex >= remainingEnemies.length, then output "let selectedEnemyIndex = 0", and select the enemy letter at remainingEnemies[0].
  The selected enemy letter is 'q'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 12

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking.

  EIGHTH: If any of these indexOf values === -1, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  All indexOf values are valid.

  NINTH: Go through the listed arrays and list only the numbers contained in those three arrays (i.e., remove the letters).
  Array six: [4, 1, 6, 8, 7, m, d]
  Array ten: [1, 7, 4, 6, 3, O, H]
  Array twentyTwo: [F, V, 7, 5, 6, G, 4, 1]

  THIRTEENTH: Sort this list.
  [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length = 7

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing.

  let selectedEnemyIndex = 12

  THIRD: Select the enemy letter to attack. Always select remainingEnemies[selectedEnemyIndex]. If selectedEnemyIndex >= remainingEnemies.length, then output "let selectedEnemyIndex = 0", and select the enemy letter at remainingEnemies[0].
  The selected enemy letter is 'C'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 13

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking. You'll find one array between arrays one and nine (inclusive), one array between ten and eighteen (inclusive), and one array between nineteen and twenty-seven (inclusive). Always list every element (every number and letter) of the three arrays found during this step.
  Array six: [4, q, 1, 6, C, 8, 7, m, d]
  Array thirteen: [5, 4, 7, 9, 1, C, f, W, 6]
  Array twentyThree: [5, 9, 4, b, 1, 3, 6, C, 8]

  SEVENTH: Go through the listed arrays and output indexOf(selectedEnemy) for each. Pay extra attention to case.
  indexOf(C) in Array six: 4
  indexOf(C) in Array thirteen: 5
  indexOf(C) in Array twentyThree: 7

  EIGHTH: If any of these indexOf values === -1, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  All indexOf values are valid.

  NINTH: Go through the listed arrays and list only the numbers contained in those three arrays (i.e., remove the letters).
  Array six: [4, 1, 6, 8, 7, m, d]
  Array thirteen: [5, 4, 7, 9, 1, f, W, 6]
  Array twentyThree: [5, 9, 4, b, 1, 3, 6, 8]

  TENTH: Concatenate the three lists into a single list.
  [4, 1, 6, 8, 7, m, d, 5, 4, 7, 9, 1, f, W, 6, 5, 9, 4, b, 1, 3, 6, 8]

  ELEVENTH: Iterate through the concatenated list and REMOVE every LETTER, if there are no letters, then just re-output the list of numbers.
  [4, 1, 6, 8, 7, 5, 4, 7, 9, 1, 6, 5, 9, 4, 1, 3, 6, 8]

  TWELFTH: Dedupe this list.
  [4, 1, 6, 8, 7, 5, 9, 3]

  THIRTEENTH: Sort this list.
  [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length = 8

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  All numbers between 1 and 9 are present.

  SIXTEENTH: Re-output the indexOf values from the SEVENTH step.
  indexOf(C) in Array six: 4
  indexOf(C) in Array thirteen: 5
  indexOf(C) in Array twentyThree: 7

  SEVENTEENTH: For each of the three arrays from earlier, replace the letter at the indexOf value with the missing number.
  Array six: [4, q, 1, 6, 2, 8, 7, m, d]
  Array thirteen: [5, 4, 7, 9, 1, 2, f, W, 6]
  Array twentyThree: [5, 9, 4, b, 1, 3, 6, 2, 8]

  EIGHTEENTH: It's time to update the game state. The first thing you are required to do is come up with a unique name for the game state. Output the name. After you output the new game state name, output "let one =" on the next line. Then carefully finish printing the new game state, making sure to be precise and careful. You want it to be exactly like the previous game state except for the new updates that occurred this KICK SWEEP! Remember to include the new remainingEnemies. The reason you must always list everything out in full is that I'm copy-pasting your most recent response into a new chat, so if you fail to list it out in full, you'll irrevocably lose the game state information and necessarily fail at the game.

  The selected enemy letter is 'd'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 14

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking. You'll find one array between arrays one and nine (inclusive), one array between ten and eighteen (inclusive), and one array between nineteen and twenty-seven (inclusive). Always list every element (every number and letter) of the three arrays found during this step.
  Array six: [4, q, 1, 6, 2, 8, 7, m, d]
  Array seventeen: [7, 1, 3, 8, 2, d, n, 6, 9]
  Array twentyFour: [6, 1, 8, j, 4, 2, 7, m, d]

  SEVENTH: Go through the listed arrays and output indexOf(selectedEnemy) for each. Pay extra attention to case.
  indexOf(d) in Array six: 8
  indexOf(d) in Array seventeen: 5
  indexOf(d) in Array twentyFour: 8

  EIGHTH: If any of these indexOf values === -1, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  All indexOf values are valid.

  NINTH: Go through the listed arrays and list only the numbers contained in those three arrays (i.e., remove the letters).
  Array six: [4, 1, 6, 2, 8, 7, m]
  Array seventeen: [7, 1, 3, 8, 2, n, 6, 9]
  Array twentyFour: [6, 1, 8, j, 4, 2, 7, m]

  TENTH: Concatenate the three lists into a single list.
  [4, 1, 6, 2, 8, 7, m, 7, 1, 3, 8, 2, n, 6, 9, 6, 1, 8, j, 4, 2, 7, m]

  ELEVENTH: Iterate through the concatenated list and REMOVE every LETTER, if there are no letters, then just re-output the list of numbers.
  [4, 1, 6, 2, 8, 7, 7, 1, 3, 8, 2, 6, 9, 6, 1, 8, 4, 2, 7]

  TWELFTH: Dedupe this list.
  [4, 1, 6, 2, 8, 7, 3, 9]

  THIRTEENTH: Sort this list.
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length = 8

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  The missing number is 5.

  SIXTEENTH: Re-output the indexOf values from the SEVENTH step.
  indexOf(d) in Array six: 8
  indexOf(d) in Array seventeen: 5
  indexOf(d) in Array twentyFour: 8

  SEVENTEENTH: For each of the three arrays from earlier, replace the letter at the indexOf value with the missing number.
  Array six: [4, q, 1, 6, 2, 8, 7, m, 5]
  Array seventeen: [7, 1, 3, 8, 2, 5, n, 6, 9]
  Array twentyFour: [6, 1, 8, j, 4, 2, 7, m, 5]

  EIGHTEENTH: It's time to update the game state. The first thing you are required to do is come up with a unique name for the game state. Output the name. After you output the new game state name, output "let one =" on the next line. Then carefully finish printing the new game state, making sure to be precise and careful. You want it to be exactly like the previous game state except for the new updates that occurred this KICK SWEEP! Remember to include the new remainingEnemies. The reason you must always list everything out in full is that I'm copy-pasting your most recent response into a new chat, so if you fail to list it out in full, you'll irrevocably lose the game state information and necessarily fail at the game.

  indexOf(f) in Array twentySix: 1

  EIGHTH: If any of these indexOf values === -1, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  All indexOf values are valid.

  NINTH: Go through the listed arrays and list only the numbers contained in those three arrays (i.e., remove the letters).
  Array seven: [6, 3, 9, R, 7, K, 5, n]
  Array thirteen: [5, 4, 7, 9, 1, 2, W, 6]
  Array twentySix: [R, 7, 1, W, A, l, 6, 5]

  TENTH: Concatenate the three lists into a single list.
  [6, 3, 9, R, 7, K, 5, n, 5, 4, 7, 9, 1, 2, W, 6, R, 7, 1, W, A, l, 6, 5]

  ELEVENTH: Iterate through the concatenated list and REMOVE every LETTER, if there are no letters, then just re-output the list of numbers.
  [6, 3, 9, 7, 5, 5, 4, 7, 9, 1, 2, 6, 7, 1, 6, 5]

  TWELFTH: Dedupe this list.
  [6, 3, 9, 7, 5, 4, 1, 2]

  THIRTEENTH: Sort this list.
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length = 8

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  The missing number is 8.

  SIXTEENTH: Re-output the indexOf values from the SEVENTH step.
  indexOf(f) in Array seven: 4
  indexOf(f) in Array thirteen: 6
  indexOf(f) in Array twentySix: 1

  SEVENTEENTH: For each of the three arrays from earlier, replace the letter at the indexOf value with the missing number.
  Array seven: [6, 3, 9, R, 8, 7, K, 5, n]
  Array thirteen: [5, 4, 7, 9, 1, 2, 8, W, 6]
  Array twentySix: [R, 8, 7, 1, W, A, l, 6, 5]

  EIGHTEENTH: It's time to update the game state. The first thing you are required to do is come up with a unique name for the game state. Output the name. After you output the new game state name, output "let one =" on the next line. Then carefully finish printing the new game state, making sure to be precise and careful. You want it to be exactly like the previous game state except for the new updates that occurred this KICK SWEEP! Remember to include the new remainingEnemies. The reason you must always list everything out in full is that I'm copy-pasting your most recent response into a new chat, so if you fail to list it out in full, you'll irrevocably lose the game state information and necessarily fail at the game.

  [6, 3, 9, 8, 7, 5, 7, 1, 3, 8, 2, 5, 6, 9, 5, 2, 6, 9]

  TWELFTH: Dedupe this list.
  [6, 3, 9, 8, 7, 5, 1, 2]

  THIRTEENTH: Sort this list.
  [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length = 8

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  The missing number is 4.

  SIXTEENTH: Re-output the indexOf values from the SEVENTH step.
  indexOf(n) in Array seven: 8
  indexOf(n) in Array seventeen: 6
  indexOf(n) in Array twentySeven: 2

  SEVENTEENTH: For each of the three arrays from earlier, replace the letter at the indexOf value with the missing number.
  Array seven: [6, 3, 9, R, 8, 7, K, 5, 4]
  Array seventeen: [7, 1, 3, 8, 2, 5, 4, 6, 9]
  Array twentySeven: [K, 5, 4, U, 2, 6, h, E, 9]

  EIGHTEENTH: It's time to update the game state. The first thing you are required to do is come up with a unique name for the game state. Output the name. After you output the new game state name, output "let one =" on the next line. Then carefully finish printing the new game state, making sure to be precise and careful. You want it to be exactly like the previous game state except for the new updates that occurred this KICK SWEEP! Remember to include the new remainingEnemies. The reason you must always list everything out in full is that I'm copy-pasting your most recent response into a new chat, so if you fail to list it out in full, you'll irrevocably lose the game state information and necessarily fail at the game.

  let selectedEnemyIndex = 18

  THIRD: Select the enemy letter to attack. Always select remainingEnemies[selectedEnemyIndex]. If selectedEnemyIndex >= remainingEnemies.length, then output "let selectedEnemyIndex = 0", and select the enemy letter at remainingEnemies[0].
  The selected enemy letter is 'A'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 19

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking. You'll find one array between arrays one and nine (inclusive), one array between ten and eighteen (inclusive), and one array between nineteen and twenty-seven (inclusive).

  EIGHTH: If any of these indexOf values === -1, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  All indexOf values are valid.

  NINTH: Go through the listed arrays and list only the numbers contained in those three arrays (i.e., remove the letters).
  Array eight: [7, 1, 3, 2, 6]
  Array fourteen: [6, 2, 1, 4, 3, 8, 7, 5]
  Array twentySix: [8, 7, 1, 3, 6, 5]

  TENTH: Concatenate the three lists into a single list.
  [7, 1, 3, 2, 6, 6, 2, 1, 4, 3, 8, 7, 5, 8, 7, 1, 3, 6, 5]

  TWELFTH: Dedupe this list.
  [7, 1, 3, 2, 6, 4, 8, 5]

  THIRTEENTH: Sort this list.
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length = 8

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  The missing number is 9.

  SIXTEENTH: Re-output the indexOf values from the SEVENTH step.
  indexOf(A) in Array eight: 5
  indexOf(A) in Array fourteen: 7
  indexOf(A) in Array twentySix: 5

  SEVENTEENTH: For each of the three arrays from earlier, replace the letter at the indexOf value with the missing number.
  Array eight: [7, O, a, 1, 3, 9, U, 2, 6]
  Array fourteen: [6, 2, 1, 4, 3, 8, 7, 9, 5]
  Array twentySix: [R, 8, 7, 1, 3, 9, l, 6, 5]

  EIGHTEENTH: It's time to update the game state. The first thing you are required to do is come up with a unique name for the game state. Output the name. After you output the new game state name, output "let one =" on the next line. Then carefully finish printing the new game state, making sure to be precise and careful.

  THIRD: Select the enemy letter to attack. Always select remainingEnemies[selectedEnemyIndex]. If selectedEnemyIndex >= remainingEnemies.length, then output "let selectedEnemyIndex = 0", and select the enemy letter at remainingEnemies[0].
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 0
  The selected enemy letter is 's'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 1

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking. You'll find one array between arrays one and nine (inclusive), one array between ten and eighteen (inclusive), and one array between nineteen and twenty-seven (inclusive). Always list every element (every number and letter) of the three arrays found during this step.

  indexOf(s) in Array one: 2
  indexOf(s) in Array eleven: 0
  indexOf(s) in Array nineteen: 2

  EIGHTH: If any of these indexOf values === -1, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  All indexOf values are valid.

  NINTH: Go through the listed arrays and list only the numbers contained in those three arrays (i.e., remove the letters).
  Array one: [2, 1, 9, 5, 6, 4, 8, 7]
  Array eleven: [5, 7, 1, 9]
  Array nineteen: [2, 1, 8, 7, 9, 4, 5]

  TENTH: Concatenate the three lists into a single list.
  [2, 1, 9, 5, 6, 4, 8, 7, 5, 7, 1, 9, 2, 1, 8, 7, 9, 4, 5]

  ELEVENTH: Iterate through the concatenated list and REMOVE every LETTER, if there are no letters, then just re-output the list of numbers.
  [2, 1, 9, 5, 6, 4, 8, 7, 5, 7, 1, 9, 2, 1, 8, 7, 9, 4, 5]

  TWELFTH: Dedupe this list.
  [2, 1, 9, 5, 6, 4, 8, 7]

  THIRTEENTH: Sort this list.
  [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length = 8

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  The missing number is 3.

  SIXTEENTH: Re-output the indexOf values from the SEVENTH step.
  indexOf(s) in Array one: 2
  indexOf(s) in Array eleven: 0
  indexOf(s) in Array nineteen: 2

  SEVENTEENTH: For each of the three arrays from earlier, replace the letter at the indexOf value with the missing number.
  Array one: [2, 1, 3, 9, 5, 6, 4, 8, 7]
  Array eleven: [3, p, 5, 7, G, 1, 9, a, T]
  Array nineteen: [2, 1, 3, 8, 7, p, 9, 4, 5]

  EIGHTEENTH: It's time to update the game state. The first thing you are required to do is come up with a unique name for the game state. Output the name. After you output the new game state name, output "let one =" on the next line. Then carefully finish printing the new game state, making sure to be precise and careful.

  let selectedEnemyIndex = 1
  The selected enemy letter is 'p'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 2

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking.

  THIRTEENTH: Sort this list.
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  The missing number is 6.

  SIXTEENTH: Re-output the indexOf values from the SEVENTH step.
  indexOf(p) in Array two: 2
  indexOf(p) in Array eleven: 1
  indexOf(p) in Array nineteen: 5

  SEVENTEENTH: For each of the three arrays from earlier, replace the letter at the indexOf value with the missing number.
  Array two: [8, 7, 6, 3, 4, 2, 5, 9, 1]
  Array eleven: [3, 6, 5, 7, G, 1, 9, a, T]

  THIRD: Select the enemy letter to attack. Always select remainingEnemies[selectedEnemyIndex]. If selectedEnemyIndex >= remainingEnemies.length, then output "let selectedEnemyIndex = 0", and select the enemy letter at remainingEnemies[0].
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 2
  The selected enemy letter is 'M'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 3

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking. You'll find one array between arrays one and nine (inclusive), one array between ten and eighteen (inclusive), and one array between nineteen and twenty-seven (inclusive).

  indexOf(M) in Array three: 3
  indexOf(M) in Array twelve: 2
  indexOf(M) in Array twenty: 6

  EIGHTH: If any of these indexOf values === -1, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  All indexOf values are valid.

  NINTH: Go through the listed arrays and list only the numbers contained in those three arrays (i.e., remove the letters).
  Array three: [9, 4, 5, 7, 1, 3]
  Array twelve: [9, 3, 5, 6, 1]
  Array twenty: [9, 5, 6, 3, 4, 2, 7, 1]

  TENTH: Concatenate the three lists into a single list.
  [9, 4, 5, 7, 1, 3, 9, 3, 5, 6, 1, 9, 5, 6, 3, 4, 2, 7, 1]

  [9, 4, 5, 7, 1, 3, 9, 3, 5, 6, 1, 9, 5, 6, 3, 4, 2, 7, 1]

  TWELFTH: Dedupe this list.
  [9, 4, 5, 7, 1, 3, 6, 2]

  THIRTEENTH: Sort this list.
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length = 8

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  The missing number is 8.

  SIXTEENTH: Re-output the indexOf values from the SEVENTH step.
  indexOf(M) in Array three: 3
  indexOf(M) in Array twelve: 2
  indexOf(M) in Array twenty: 6

  SEVENTEENTH: For each of the three arrays from earlier, replace the letter at the indexOf value with the missing number.
  Array three: [9, 4, 5, 8, 7, 1, S, k, 3]
  Array twelve: [9, 3, 8, 5, b, 6, R, 1, l]
  Array twenty: [9, 5, 6, 3, 4, 2, 8, 7, 1]

  EIGHTEENTH: It's time to update the game state. The first thing you are required to do is come up with a unique name for the game state. Output the name. After you output the new game state name, output "let one =" on the next line. Then carefully finish printing the new game state, making sure to be precise and careful.

  THIRD: Select the enemy letter to attack. Always select remainingEnemies[selectedEnemyIndex]. If selectedEnemyIndex >= remainingEnemies.length, then output "let selectedEnemyIndex = 0", and select the enemy letter at remainingEnemies[0].
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 3
  The selected enemy letter is 'F'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 4

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking. You'll find one array between arrays one and nine (inclusive), one array between ten and eighteen (inclusive), and one array between nineteen and twenty-seven (inclusive).

  indexOf(F) in Array twentyTwo: 0

  EIGHTH: If any of these indexOf values === -1, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  All indexOf values are valid.

  NINTH: Go through the listed arrays and list only the numbers contained in those three arrays (i.e., remove the letters).
  Array four: [7, 5, 9, 4, 6, 1, 8]
  Array eighteen: [2, 8, 9, 5, 4, 6, 7, 1]
  Array twentyTwo: [7, 5, 6, 4, 1]

  [7, 5, 9, 4, 6, 1, 8, 2, 8, 9, 5, 4, 6, 7, 1, 7, 5, 6, 4, 1]

  TWELFTH: Dedupe this list.
  [7, 5, 9, 4, 6, 1, 8, 2]

  THIRTEENTH: Sort this list.
  [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length = 8

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  The missing number is 3.

  SIXTEENTH: Re-output the indexOf values from the SEVENTH step.
  indexOf(F) in Array four: 0
  indexOf(F) in Array eighteen: 3
  indexOf(F) in Array twentyTwo: 0

  SEVENTEENTH: For each of the three arrays from earlier, replace the letter at the indexOf value with the missing number.
  Array four: [3, V, 7, 5, 9, 4, 6, 1, 8]
  Array eighteen: [2, 8, 9, 3, 5, 4, 6, 7, 1]
  Array twentyTwo: [3, V, 7, 5, 6, G, 4, q, 1]

  EIGHTEENTH: It's time to update the game state. The first thing you are required to do is come up with a unique name for the game state. Output the name. After you output the new game state name, output "let one =" on the next line. Then carefully finish printing the new game state, making sure to be precise and careful.

  let selectedEnemyIndex = 4
  The selected enemy letter is 'G'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 5

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking.
