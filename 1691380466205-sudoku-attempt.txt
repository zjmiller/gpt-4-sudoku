  THIRD: Select the enemy letter to attack. Always select remainingEnemies[selectedEnemyIndex]. If selectedEnemyIndex >= remainingEnemies.length, then output "let selectedEnemyIndex = 0", and select the enemy letter at remainingEnemies[0].
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 6
  The selected enemy letter is 'm'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 7

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking. You'll find one array between arrays one and nine (inclusive), one array between ten and eighteen (inclusive), and one array between nineteen and twenty-seven (inclusive).

  indexOf(m) in Array six: 7
  indexOf(m) in Array sixteen: 5
  indexOf(m) in Array twentyFour: 7

  EIGHTH: If any of these indexOf values === -1, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  All indexOf values are valid.

  NINTH: Go through the listed arrays and list only the numbers contained in those three arrays (i.e., remove the letters).
  Array six: [4, 1, 6, 2, 8, 7, 5]
  Array sixteen: [8, 9, 1, 4, 5, 2]
  Array twentyFour: [6, 1, 8, 4, 2, 7, 5]

  TENTH: Concatenate the three lists into a single list.
  [4, 1, 6, 2, 8, 7, 5, 8, 9, 1, 4, 5, 2, 6, 1, 8, 4, 2, 7, 5]

  ELEVENTH: Iterate through the concatenated list and REMOVE every LETTER, if there are no letters, then just re-output the list of numbers.
  [4, 1, 6, 2, 8, 7, 5, 8, 9, 1, 4, 5, 2, 6, 1, 8, 4, 2, 7, 5]

  TWELFTH: Dedupe this list.
  [4, 1, 6, 2, 8, 7, 5, 9]

  THIRTEENTH: Sort this list.
  [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length = 8

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  The missing number is 3.

  SIXTEENTH: Re-output the indexOf values from the SEVENTH step.
  indexOf(m) in Array six: 7
  indexOf(m) in Array sixteen: 5
  indexOf(m) in Array twentyFour: 7

  SEVENTEENTH: For each of the three arrays from earlier, replace the letter at the indexOf value with the missing number.
  Array six: [4, q, 1, 6, 2, 8, 7, 3, 5]
  Array sixteen: [8, 9, k, 1, 4, 3, 5, 2, E]
  Array twentyFour: [6, 1, 8, j, 4, 2, 7, 3, 5]

  EIGHTEENTH: It's time to update the game state. The first thing you are required to do is come up with a unique name for the game state. Output the name. After you output the new game state name, output "let one =" on the next line. Then carefully finish printing the new game state, making sure to be precise and careful. You want it to be exactly like the previous game state except for the new updates that occurred this KICK SWEEP! Remember to include the new remainingEnemies. The reason you must always list everything out in full is that I'm copy-pasting your most recent response into a new chat, so if you fail to list it out in full, you'll irrevocably lose the game state information and necessarily fail at the game.

  THIRD: Select the enemy letter to attack. Always select remainingEnemies[selectedEnemyIndex]. If selectedEnemyIndex >= remainingEnemies.length, then output "let selectedEnemyIndex = 0", and select the enemy letter at remainingEnemies[0].
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 7
  The selected enemy letter is 'R'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 8

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking. You'll find one array between arrays one and nine (inclusive), one array between ten and eighteen (inclusive), and one array between nineteen and twenty-seven (inclusive). Always list every element (every number and letter) of the three arrays found during this step.

  indexOf(R) in Array seven: 3
  indexOf(R) in Array twelve: 6
  indexOf(R) in Array twentySix: 0

  EIGHTH: If any of these indexOf values === -1, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  All indexOf values are valid.

  NINTH: Go through the listed arrays and list only the numbers contained in those three arrays (i.e., remove the letters).
  Array seven: [6, 3, 9, 8, 7, 5, 4]
  Array twelve: [9, 3, 8, 5, 6, 1]
  Array twentySix: [8, 7, 1, 3, 9, 6, 5]

  TENTH: Concatenate the three lists into a single list.
  [6, 3, 9, 8, 7, 5, 4, 9, 3, 8, 5, 6, 1, 8, 7, 1, 3, 9, 6, 5]

  [6, 3, 9, 8, 7, 5, 4, 9, 3, 8, 5, 6, 1, 8, 7, 1, 3, 9, 6, 5]

  TWELFTH: Dedupe this list.
  [6, 3, 9, 8, 7, 5, 4, 1]

  THIRTEENTH: Sort this list.
  [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length = 8

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  The missing number is 2.

  SIXTEENTH: Re-output the indexOf values from the SEVENTH step.
  indexOf(R) in Array seven: 3
  indexOf(R) in Array twelve: 6
  indexOf(R) in Array twentySix: 0

  SEVENTEENTH: For each of the three arrays from earlier, replace the letter at the indexOf value with the missing number.
  Array seven: [6, 3, 9, 2, 8, 7, K, 5, 4]
  Array twelve: [9, 3, 8, 5, b, 6, 2, 1, l]
  Array twentySix: [2, 8, 7, 1, 3, 9, l, 6, 5]

  EIGHTEENTH: It's time to update the game state. The first thing you are required to do is come up with a unique name for the game state. Output the name. After you output the new game state name, output "let one =" on the next line. Then carefully finish printing the new game state, making sure to be precise and careful.

  The selected enemy letter is 'O'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 9

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking.

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length = 7

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing.

  let selectedEnemyIndex = 9
  The selected enemy letter is 'U'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 10

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking. You'll find one array between arrays one and nine (inclusive), one array between ten and eighteen (inclusive), and one array between nineteen and twenty-seven (inclusive). Always list every element (every number and letter) of the three arrays found during this step.
  Array seven: [6, 3, 9, 2, 8, 7, K, 5, 4]
  Array fifteen: [4, 5, S, 6, j, 7, K, U, h]
  Array twentySeven: [K, 5, 4, U, 2, 6, h, E, 9]

  SEVENTH: Go through the listed arrays and output indexOf(selectedEnemy) for each. Pay extra attention to case.
  indexOf(U) in Array seven: -1
  indexOf(U) in Array fifteen: 7
  indexOf(U) in Array twentySeven: 3

  EIGHTH: If any of these indexOf values === -1, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.

  EIGHTEENTH: It's time to update the game state. The first thing you are required to do is come up with a unique name for the game state. Output the name. After you output the new game state name, output "let one =" on the next line. Then carefully finish printing the new game state, making sure to be precise and careful. You want it to be exactly like the previous game state except for the new updates that occurred this KICK SWEEP! Remember to include the new remainingEnemies. The reason you must always list everything out in full is that I'm copy-pasting your most recent response into a new chat, so if you fail to list it out in full, you'll irrevocably lose the game state information and necessarily fail at the game.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 2

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking.

  EIGHTH: If any of these indexOf values === -1, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  All indexOf values are valid.

  NINTH: Go through the listed arrays and list only the numbers contained in those three arrays (i.e., remove the letters).
  Array three: [9, 4, 5, 8, 7, 1, 3]
  Array sixteen: [8, 9, 1, 4, 3, 5, 2, 7]

  The missing number between 1 and 9 is 6.

  SIXTEENTH: Re-output the indexOf values from the SEVENTH step.
  indexOf(k) in Array three: 7
  indexOf(k) in Array sixteen: 2
  indexOf(k) in Array twentyOne: 7

  EIGHTEENTH: It's time to update the game state. The first thing you are required to do is come up with a unique name for the game state. Output the name. After you output the new game state name, output "let one =" on the next line. Then carefully finish printing the new game state, making sure to be precise and careful.

  let remainingEnemies = [S, V, b, j, q, K, O, a, U, H, T, h]

  THIRD: Select the enemy letter to attack. Always select remainingEnemies[selectedEnemyIndex]. If selectedEnemyIndex >= remainingEnemies.length, then output "let selectedEnemyIndex = 0", and select the enemy letter at remainingEnemies[0].
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 2
  The selected enemy letter is 'V'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 3

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking. You'll find one array between arrays one and nine (inclusive), one array between ten and eighteen (inclusive), and one array between nineteen and twenty-seven (inclusive). Always list every element (every number and letter) of the three arrays found during this step.

  indexOf(V) in Array four: 1
  indexOf(V) in Array ten: 3
  indexOf(V) in Array twentyTwo: 1

  EIGHTH: If any of these indexOf values === -1, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  All indexOf values are valid.

  NINTH: Go through the listed arrays and list only the numbers contained in those three arrays (i.e., remove the letters).
  Array four: [3, 7, 5, 9, 4, 6, 1, 8]
  Array ten: [1, 7, 4, 6, 3, O, H]
  Array twentyTwo: [3, 7, 5, 6, 8, 4, 1]

  TENTH: Concatenate the three lists into a single list.
  Concatenated list: [3, 7, 5, 9, 4, 6, 1, 8, 1, 7, 4, 6, 3, O, H, 3, 7, 5, 6, 8, 4, 1]

  ELEVENTH: Iterate through the concatenated list and REMOVE every LETTER, if there are no letters, then just re-output the list of numbers.
  List of numbers: [3, 7, 5, 9, 4, 6, 1, 8, 1, 7, 4, 6, 3, 3, 7, 5, 6, 8, 4, 1]

  TWELFTH: Dedupe this list.
  Deduped list: [3, 7, 5, 9, 4, 6, 1, 8]

  THIRTEENTH: Sort this list.
  Sorted list: [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length: 8

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  The missing number between 1 and 9 is 2.

  SIXTEENTH: Re-output the indexOf values from the SEVENTH step.
  indexOf(V) in Array four: 1
  indexOf(V) in Array ten: 3
  indexOf(V) in Array twentyTwo: 1

  SEVENTEENTH: For each of the three arrays from earlier, replace the letter at the indexOf value with the missing number.
  Array four: [3, 2, 7, 5, 9, 4, 6, 1, 8]
  Array ten: [1, 7, 4, 2, 6, q, 3, O, H]
  Array twentyTwo: [3, 2, 7, 5, 6, 8, 4, q, 1]

  EIGHTEENTH: It's time to update the game state. The first thing you are required to do is come up with a unique name for the game state. Output the name. After you output the new game state name, output "let one =" on the next line. Then carefully finish printing the new game state, making sure to be precise and careful.

  THIRD: Select the enemy letter to attack. Always select remainingEnemies[selectedEnemyIndex]. If selectedEnemyIndex >= remainingEnemies.length, then output "let selectedEnemyIndex = 0", and select the enemy letter at remainingEnemies[0].
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 3
  The selected enemy letter is 'b'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 4

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking. You'll find one array between arrays one and nine (inclusive), one array between ten and eighteen (inclusive), and one array between nineteen and twenty-seven (inclusive).

  indexOf(b) in Array twentyThree: 3

  EIGHTH: If any of these indexOf values === -1, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  All indexOf values are valid.

  ELEVENTH: Iterate through the concatenated list and REMOVE every LETTER, if there are no letters, then just re-output the list of numbers.
  List of numbers: [5, 6, 8, 1, 3, 4, 2, 9, 3, 8, 5, 6, 2, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 1, 3, 6, 2, 8]

  TWELFTH: Dedupe this list.
  Deduped list: [5, 6, 8, 1, 3, 4, 2, 9]

  THIRTEENTH: Sort this list.
  Sorted list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length: 8

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  The missing number between 1 and 9 is 7.

  SIXTEENTH: Re-output the indexOf values from the SEVENTH step.
  indexOf(b) in Array five: 3
  indexOf(b) in Array twelve: 4
  indexOf(b) in Array twentyThree: 3

  SEVENTEENTH: For each of the three arrays from earlier, replace the letter at the indexOf value with the missing number.
  Array five: [5, 6, 8, 7, 1, 3, j, 4, 2]
  Array twelve: [9, 3, 8, 5, 7, 6, 2, 1, 4]
  Array twentyThree: [5, 9, 4, 7, 1, 3, 6, 2, 8]

  EIGHTEENTH: It's time to update the game state. The first thing you are required to do is come up with a unique name for the game state. Output the name.

  The selected enemy letter is 'K'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 5

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking.

  The missing number between 1 and 9 is 1.

  SIXTEENTH: Re-output the indexOf values from the SEVENTH step.
  indexOf(K) in Array seven: 6
  indexOf(K) in Array fifteen: 6
  indexOf(K) in Array twentySeven: 0

  SEVENTEENTH: For each of the three arrays from earlier, replace the letter at the indexOf value with the missing number.
  Array seven: [6, 3, 9, 2, 8, 7, 1, 5, 4]
  Array fifteen: [4, 5, S, 6, j, 7, 1, U, h]

  The selected enemy letter is 'a'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 6

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking.

If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  The missing number between 1 and 9 is 4.

  SIXTEENTH: Re-output the indexOf values from the SEVENTH step.
  indexOf(a) in Array eight: 2
  indexOf(a) in Array eleven: 7
  indexOf(a) in Array twentyFive: 5

  SEVENTEENTH: For each of the three arrays from earlier, replace the letter at the indexOf value with the missing number.
  Array eight: [7, O, 4, 1, 3, 9, U, 2, 6]
  Array eleven: [3, 6, 5, 7, 8, 1, 9, 4, T]
  Array twentyFive: [6, 3, 9, 7, O, 4, 1, H, T]

  EIGHTEENTH: It's time to update the game state. The first thing you are required to do is come up with a unique name for the game state. Output the name.

  let remainingEnemies = [S, j, q, O, U, H, T, h]

  THIRD: Select the enemy letter to attack. Always select remainingEnemies[selectedEnemyIndex]. If selectedEnemyIndex >= remainingEnemies.length, then output "let selectedEnemyIndex = 0", and select the enemy letter at remainingEnemies[0].
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 6
  The selected enemy letter is 'H'.

  FOURTH: Increment selectedEnemyIndex by 1.
  let selectedEnemyIndex = 7

  FIFTH: Go through the most recent version of the 27 arrays one by one and list the three arrays that contain the enemy you are attacking. You'll find one array between arrays one and nine (inclusive), one array between ten and eighteen (inclusive), and one array between nineteen and twenty-seven (inclusive). Always list every element (every number and letter) of the three arrays found during this step.

  indexOf(H) in Array nine: 1
  indexOf(H) in Array ten: 8
  indexOf(H) in Array twentyFive: 7

  EIGHTH: If any of these indexOf values === -1, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  All indexOf values are valid.

  NINTH: Go through the listed arrays and list only the numbers contained in those three arrays (i.e., remove the letters).
  Array nine: [1, T, 4, 6, 5, h, 7, 9]
  Array ten: [1, 7, 4, 2, 6, q, 3, O]
  Array twentyFive: [6, 3, 9, 7, O, 4, 1, T]

  TENTH: Concatenate the three lists into a single list.
  Concatenated list: [1, T, 4, 6, 5, h, 7, 9, 1, 7, 4, 2, 6, q, 3, O, 6, 3, 9, 7, O, 4, 1, T]

  ELEVENTH: Iterate through the concatenated list and REMOVE every LETTER, if there are no letters, then just re-output the list of numbers.
  List of numbers: [1, 4, 6, 5, 7, 9, 1, 7, 4, 2, 6, 3, 6, 3, 9, 7, 4, 1]

  TWELFTH: Dedupe this list.
  Deduped list: [1, 4, 6, 5, 7, 9, 2, 3]

  THIRTEENTH: Sort this list.
  Sorted list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length: 8

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  The missing number between 1 and 9 is 8.

  SIXTEENTH: Re-output the indexOf values from the SEVENTH step.
  indexOf(H) in Array nine: 1
  indexOf(H) in Array ten: 8
  indexOf(H) in Array twentyFive: 7

  SEVENTEENTH: For each of the three arrays from earlier, replace the letter at the indexOf value with the missing number.
  Array nine: [1, 8, T, 4, 6, 5, h, 7, 9]
  Array ten: [1, 7, 4, 2, 6, q, 3, O, 8]
  Array twentyFive: [6, 3, 9, 7, O, 4, 1, 8, T]

  EIGHTEENTH: It's time to update the game state. The first thing you are required to do is come up with a unique name for the game state. Output the name. After you output the new game state name, output "let one =" on the next line. Then carefully finish printing the new game state, making sure to be precise and careful.

  Sorted list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

  FOURTEENTH: Count the number of numbers in this list to determine list.length
  list.length: 8

  FIFTEENTH (Mantra: It must equal 8 to be a hit, it must equal 8, it must equal 8. 7 is bad, so very bad. 7 is NEVER a hit! But 8 is so very good. 8 is ALWAYS a hit!) If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  The missing number between 1 and 9 is 9.

  SIXTEENTH: Re-output the indexOf values from the SEVENTH step.
  indexOf(q) in Array six: 1
  indexOf(q) in Array ten: 5
  indexOf(q) in Array twentyTwo: 7

  SEVENTEENTH: For each of the three arrays from earlier, replace the letter at the indexOf value with the missing number.
  Array six: [4, 9, 1, 6, 2, 8, 7, 3, 5]
  Array ten: [1, 7, 4, 2, 6, 9, 3, O, 8]
  Array twentyTwo: [3, 2, 7, 5, 6, 8, 4, 9, 1]

  EIGHTEENTH: It's time to update the game state. The first thing you are required to do is come up with a unique name for the game state. Output the name. After you output the new game state name, output "let one =" on the next line. Then carefully finish printing the new game state, making sure to be precise and careful. You want it to be exactly like the previous game state except for the new updates that occurred this KICK SWEEP! Remember to include the new remainingEnemies. The reason you must always list everything out in full is that I'm copy-pasting your most recent response into a new chat, so if you fail to list it out in full, you'll irrevocably lose the game state information and necessarily fail at the game.

If list.length === 8, then exactly one number between 1 and 9 must be missing from the list. Determine which number between 1 and 9 is missing. If list.length !== 8, immediately output CRITICAL HIT ABORTED! and await further instructions.
  The missing number between 1 and 9 is 5.

  SIXTEENTH: Re-output the indexOf values from the SEVENTH step.
  indexOf(O) in Array eight: 1
  indexOf(O) in Array ten: 7
  indexOf(O) in Array twentyFive: 4

  SEVENTEENTH: For each of the three arrays from earlier, replace the letter at the indexOf value with the missing number.
  Array eight: [7, 5, 4, 1, 3, 9, U, 2, 6]
  Array ten: [1, 7, 4, 2, 6, 9, 3, 5, 8]
  Array twentyFive: [6, 3, 9, 7, 5, 4, 1, 8, T]

  EIGHTEENTH: It's time to update the game state. The first thing you are required to do is come up with a unique name for the game state. Output the name. After you output the new game state name, output "let one =" on the next line. Then carefully finish printing the new game state, making sure to be precise and careful. You want it to be exactly like the previous game state except for the new updates that occurred this KICK SWEEP! Remember to include the new remainingEnemies. The reason you must always list everything out in full is that I'm copy-pasting your most recent response into a new chat, so if you fail to list it out in full, you'll irrevocably lose the game state information and necessarily fail at the game.
